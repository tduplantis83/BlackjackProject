### Lessons Learned
As with the other projects so far, this one reinforced the importance of planning before coding. Taking time to think through the application, create even a basic UML diagram, and stubbing out classes and methods, saves a great deal of time overall.

In the future, I would like to begin learning and utilizing Test Driven Development very intensely, in an effort to save time, while also making future modifications simpler.
